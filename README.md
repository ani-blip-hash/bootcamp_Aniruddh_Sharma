# Optimizing Bike-Sharing Demand in New York City

## Project Scoping Paragraph

New York City's public bike-sharing system experiences fluctuating demand across neighborhoods and times of day. This causes shortages in high-demand areas and surpluses in low-demand areas, reducing efficiency and user satisfaction.

The primary stakeholder is CitiBike's operations team. This project will create a **predictive model** that forecasts demand for the next 24 hours. Outputs will be a **metric** (predicted number of bikes needed per station) and an **artifact** (interactive dashboard).
